## Overview

### The Project

This project came to my mind one evening when I was looking for something to watch on the streaming services with which I have a subscription, spending hours without being able to make up my mind. So I came up with Watch That Movie. No search, you can only view the trending movies or series at that moment and have the app select which movie to watch in a totally random way, by entering only the type (if movie or series), genre and streaming services.

Users should be able to:

- Scroll through the trending movies or series, depending on which country they're connecting from
- Randomly get a movie or series suggestion to watch depending on their streaming services
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
